<center><b>Kakuma Tangazo App Project</b><p><b></b></p></center>
<b>Introduction</b><p><b></b>
The only channel for communication between  humanitarian agencies, refugee and host community members traditional boards where calls for interviews, job advertisments, education opportunities and other important information such as health information important to both the refugee community and the community are posted.  However, it has proven that these printed information and communications posted on the physical boards by NGOs do not always reach to all residents of Kakuma and beyond.</p><p>

We at Kakuma Tangazo App Project this a huge problem to the both the refugee community and the host community alike.  To  address problmem and solve this problem we came with an idea to create an application with graphical user interface to brigde communication gap between the refugee-host communities and the humanitarians orgainzation working in Kakuma refugee camp.</p><p>
Through Kakuma Tangazo applicatin, humanitarian orgainzations working in Kukuma refugee camp would be able to provide thier clients with accurate, timely maner and such information will be available to individuals from the refugee and the host community</p><p>
<b>Major Problems with Physical Boards</b></p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Advertisements posted on Boards are removed away by people<br>
</li><li>Advertisements posted on the Boards are sometimes also removed by rain or wind<br>
</li><li>Interview calls and information posted on boards by humanitarian agencies including UNHCR calls are removed without being read by the intended audience<br>
<br>
<b>Refugees and the host community members will use Kakuma Tangazo App to receive</b><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Information from NGOs and UNHCR on the timely manner.  Just from their Kakuma Tangazo App.<br>
</li><li>Information from Refugge Affiars Refugee Affairs Secretariat RAS about the services and emergencies.<br>
</li><li>Information on job advertisements for refugees and host community members.<br>
</li><li>Information education opportunities for refugees and host community members.<br>
</li><li>Information on health and sometimes on disease outbreakes and emergencies.<br>
</li><li>Calls for interviews for refugees and host community members.<br> <p>

<b>Advantages of Kakuma Tangazo App</b></p><p>
Contrary to the raditional and physical advertisement boards in Kakuma where call for interviews, advertisements, education or training opportunities and other information are posted, refugees and host the host community members always have to struggle to visit these boards at least twice a day or they will miss the information, KaKuma Tangazo App will eliminate these burdens.  And thus Kakuma Tangazo App will provide to individuals who will be using our App these following advantages;</p><p>
<b>How Kakuma Tangazo App will work and how refugees and the host community members will access it and uses</b></p><p>
Once the Kakuma Tangazo App is developed and made ready it will available on Google Play Store for the refugee and host community members to downlaod it and install it on their smart phones. Within the app itself, the organizations operating in kakuma refugee camp will be enlisted and each organization should have thier accounts to enable them to accesss the app and post their information for refugees and the host community members to access them.  For refugees to access it, they first need to download the app from Google Play Store and install it on thier smart phones. Then each each refugee and host member who will access and use our app will create an account using thier individuals as provided on UNHCR's manifest and for the host community members, they will use thier national ID information to create thier account in order to be able to receive updates from NGOs working in Kakuma and Kalabayei.  
</p><ul>
<li>Refugees and the host community members will not miss information.<br>
</li><li>No need to go to physical board everyday for checking whether you are shortlisted for interview or not, you will just be checking it directly from your Kakuma Tangazo App.<br>
</li><li>Refugees and the host community members will always remain updated.<br>
