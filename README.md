# Kakauma Announcement (Tangazo) App Project
An app to bridge communication gap between refugees and NGOs
Introduction
The only channel for communication between  humanitarian agencies, refugee and host community members traditional boards where calls for interviews, job advertisments, education opportunities and other important information such as health information important to both the refugee community and the community are posted.  However, it has proven that these printed information and communications posted on the physical boards by NGOs do not always reach to all residents of Kakuma and beyond.
